/** Concurrency is where two or more tasks can be executed in 'parallel'. i.e. concurrently.
 * A number of tasks can be executed independently but concurrently by running them
 * in their own Threads.
 * Demonstrates how to create a Runnable object and execute it on a Thread.
 * A Runnable is an object that implements the Runnable interface,
 * meaning that it defines a run() method containing code to be executed in a Thread.
 * A Thread is a 'separate path of execution' that can execute a Runnable task
 * independently of the main thread of execution.
 * The main thread is also called the User-Interface Thread (or UI-Thread)
