/** Concurrency is where two or more tasks can be executed in 'parallel'. i.e. concurrently.
 * A number of tasks can be executed independently and concurrently by running them
 * in separate Threads.
 * This sample demonstrates how to create a Runnable object and execute it on a Thread.
 * A Runnable is an object that implements the "Runnable" interface,
 * meaning that it must define a run() method containing code to be executed in a Thread.
 * A Thread is a 'separate path of execution' that can execute a Runnable task
 * independently of the main thread of execution.
 * The main thread is called the User-Interface Thread (or UI-Thread) - all programs
 * have a default main UI-Thread (where the code in main() runs)
 *
 * If two threads run Concurrently, it means that one runs fora short time, then the other runs,
 * then back to the first one, and so on.  Their execution is Interleaved (or switched over and back)
 *
